# Predict the estimated time of arrival (ETA) for motorbike deliveries in Nairobi - part of Sendy Logistics Challenge


This is a private hackathon whose primary purpose is for the members of the EXPLORE Data Science Academy to apply what they have learnt. 

Sendy, in partnership with insight2impact facility, hosted a Zindi challenge to predict the estimated time of delivery of orders, from the point of driver pickup to the point of arrival at final destination.

We are team Hermes or Hermès and are officially referred to as Team_15_JHB_#Hermès. We are not offended if you can't write that special "è". 

We are named after Hermes a deity in ancient Greek religion and mythology. 

Hermes is considered the herald of the gods, as well as the protector of human heralds, travellers, thieves, merchants, and orators. He is able to move quickly and freely between the worlds of the mortal and the divine, aided by his winged sandals. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes)

Like this deity, we are well-positioned to address the business challenge facing Sendy and we will be applying our knowledge of Machine Learning and Regression in solving this commercial issue.

# More on the Sendy Challenge

The solution will help Sendy enhance customer communication and improve the reliability of its service; which will ultimately improve customer experience. In addition, the solution will enable Sendy to realise cost savings, and ultimately reduce the cost of doing business, through improved resource management and planning for order scheduling.

Data is a critical component in helping Sendy to build more efficient, affordable and accessible solutions. Given the details of a Sendy order, can we use historic data to predict an accurate time for the arrival of the rider at the destination of a package? In this competition, we’re challenging you to build a model that predicts an accurate delivery time, from picking up a package to arriving at the final destination. An accurate arrival time prediction will help all businesses to improve their logistics and communicate an accurate time to their customers.

# Regression

To solve the business challenge we will use Regression which is a type of supervised learning and a subset of machine learning. We will apply this to work out how some inputs relate to some outputs.
